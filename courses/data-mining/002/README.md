# Cypher queries to Neo4J

For the purpose of the assignment, we have created a Neo4J graph with version 4.0.0. Also the *APOC* plugin should be installed to the Neo4J graph.

Note that the following line should be added to the *neo4j.conf* file, so as to enable JSON importing with the APOC plugin:

```bash
apoc.import.file.enabled=true
```

All Cypher queries have been executed through the Neo4J Browser app.

# Python interface to Neo4J

The current release of Neo4J Python driver (1.7.6) requires a Neo4J graph version 3.5.14. In order to meet the requirements, we have created a graph in Neo4J Desktop that adheres to the required version. Also the *APOC* plugin should be installed to the Neo4J graph.

Note that the following line should be added to the *neo4j.conf* file, so as to enable JSON importing with the APOC plugin:

```bash
apoc.import.file.enabled=true
```
